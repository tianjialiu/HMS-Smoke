# HMS-Smoke
NOAA's Hazard Mapping System ([HMS](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html)) Smoke Product

The [HMS Smoke Explorer](https://globalfires.earthengine.app/view/hms-smoke) allows end-users to visualize NOAA's Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke product, MODIS active fires and aerosol optical depth, and GOES-16/17 (East/West) RGB imagery. Since 2005, NOAA analysts manually inspect visible imagery (e.g. GOES, MODIS, VIIRS) and outline the extent of smoke across North America, classified into three density categories: light, medium, and heavy, to produce the HMS smoke product.
