# HMS-Smoke
NOAA's Hazard Mapping System ([HMS](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html)) Smoke Product

The [HMS Smoke Explorer](https://globalfires.earthengine.app/view/hms-smoke) allows end-users to visualize NOAA's Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke product, MODIS active fires and aerosol optical depth, and GOES-East/West RGB imagery. Since 2005, NOAA analysts manually inspect visible imagery (e.g. GOES, MODIS, VIIRS) and outline the extent of smoke across North America, classified into three density categories: light, medium, and heavy, to produce the HMS smoke product.

### HMS on EE
The processed HMS smoke product can be used for analysis on Earth Engine (EE) and downloaded as yearly files.
```
// read HMS polygons by year
var inYear = 2020;
var HMS = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/GlobalFires/HMS/HMS_' + inYear);

// filter by month and day
var inMonth = 8;
var inDay = 1;
var HMSday = HMS.filter(ee.Filter.eq('Month',8)).filter(ee.Filter.eq('Day',1));

Map.addLayer(HMSday);
Map.centerObject(HMSday);
print(HMSday);
```

| Variable | Description | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
ID | Unique ID for each polygon | YYYYJJJ (1-4 = year, 5-7 = day of year, 8-11 = original row of a polygon in that day's raw HMS file)
Year | Year | 2005-present
Month | Month | 1-12
Day | Day | 1-31
JDay | Julian day or DOY | 1-365 
Start | Start time | HHMM
End | End time | HHMM
StSec | Start time | seconds since 1970-01-01
EndSec | End time | seconds since 1970-01-01
Duration | End time minus start time, with a 15-min buffer | hours
Density | Density of smoke polygon | 'Light', 'Medium', 'Heavy', or 'Unspecified'
Satellite | Satellite used as a reference for the polygon | e.g., 'GOES-EAST', 'GOES-WEST'
Area | Area of polygon | km<sup>2</sup>
QAFlag | QA flag | 0-5 (valid: 0 = good, 1 = coordinates adjusted, 2 = unclosed rings; invalid and not included in SHP: 3 = linestring, 4 = point / empty, 5 = crossed edges)
IsMulti | Is the polygon a multipolygon? | 'Y' or 'N'
fillFlag* | Flag on gap-filling smoke density | 0 = no gapfill, 1 = gapfill (model with AOD), 2 = gapfill (model without AOD)
fillConf* | Confidence on gap-filled density based on predicted model outcomes from bootstrapping (polygons that did not need gap-filling are automatically labeled with a value of 1) | 0-1

&ast; only relevant for 2005-2010, so HMS files for only those years have these columns on EE

Notes:
* The start and end time represent the time bounds of the satellite images used to draw the HMS polygons, not the actual persistence duration of the smoke plume
* In the tool, duration is used to estimate the annual contribution of each smoke density category at a particular location
* For QA = 1, out-of-bounds coordinates with y > 90 or y < -90 are removed (removes some anomalous coordinates), x < -180 is forced to be x = -180 as this may lead to disfigured polygons on EE
* For QA = 2, the first coordinate is repeated at the end of the list of coordinates to close the polygon ring

### Caveats
* The HMS smoke product represents smoke as seen from satellites. In some places, smoke may be aloft and may not affect surface air quality. This is particularly true for light smoke.
* Use caution when assessing trends in smoke using the HMS smoke product outside of CONUS. Note the lower spatial coverage in earlier years, which can be seen from the artificial boundaries in annual aggregates.
* The HMS 'Duration' is calculated from the start and end times of satellite images used to outline the smoke. Thus, it is not an estimate of the true smoke duration. HMS analysts outline smoke using only daytime satellite imagery and generally analyze heavy smoke twice per day in the morning and late afternoon.
* HMS smoke polygons in 2005-2007, 2009, and some in 2008 and 2010 are not classified into smoke density classes (light, medium, heavy). We used random forest modeling to assign densities to all such polygons.
* HMS smoke polygons with bad geometries and throws an error in R (i.e. drawn as lines rather than polygons, edges crossing edges) have been removed.
* GOES-16/East became operational on December 18, 2017, GOES-17/West on February 12, 2019, and GOES-18/West on January 4, 2023 (replacing GOES-17/West). Note these dates when selecting the GOES RGB images.

### Gap-filling Unspecified Densities
We used random forest classification to assign densities (light, medium, or heavy) to polygons with unspecified densities from 2005-2010. This procedure is described in [Liu et al. (in review)](https://doi.org/10.31223/X51963). Note that the code has recently been updated to use `sf` instead of `rgdal`, and additional processing has been done to fix more bad geometries. The code workflow uses EE to generate some input data for the random forest model (`HMS_Stack.js`,`HMS_AOD.js`). The rest of the workflow is in R with `RFmodel_prepare.R` to output a CSV table of data for all HMS polygons from 2005-2022, `RFmodel_withAOD.R` and `RFmodel_withoutAOD.R` to run the random forest classification models, `RFmodel_export.R` to output another CSV table now with the gap-filled densities, and finally `HMS_gapfill_shp.R` to rewrite HMS files from 2005-2010 with the gap-filled densities and associated flags.

### Updates
* September 2023: uploaded gap-filled HMS polygons from 2005-2010 and added related code; added ancillary code for preprocessing; added note about evaluation of the HMS smoke product in app
* July 2023: updated R code to process HMS from rgdal to sf, code is now more inclusive of out-of-bounds polygons and attempts to fix some bad geometries (unclosed rings and out-of-bounds coordinates) but excludes polygons with crossed edges as sf cannot fix them; added QA flags; added jump to latest button
* September 2020: added option to select GOES-East or GOES-West full disk imagery, added CAMS PM<sub>2.5</sub> and AOD
* August 2020: added visualization of GOES RGB imagery, HMS smoke days and 'duration'
